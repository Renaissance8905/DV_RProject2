## 00. Create/Clone a github repository
Go to SourceTree software. Create new git repository in DataVisualization folder (on same level as DrCannata folder).
![](./Graphics/createrepo.png)

If did not create the repo, clone the repo in SourceTree software.

## 01. Create RStudio Project
Create an RStudio project in the project folder.
![](./Graphics/createproject01.png)

## 02. Setup RStudio 
 Create three folders in RStudio Project:  
   **00 Doc**: where .Rmd lives  
   **01 Data**: where data will be stored  
   **02 Visualizations**: where data is explored in ggplot

## 03. Download .CSV File

Download csv file documenting all vehicle recalls in Cannada.

## 04. ETL

## 05. Peculiarities
  -removing manufacturer no as this caused floating point errors:

## 06. Summary and Subset

Creating dataframe from Oracle's database with SQL query:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
df <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('129.152.144.84:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from recalls"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521/PDBF15DV.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal', USER='cs329e_qan74', PASS='orcl_qan74', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE), ))
```

### Summary of Dataframe

```{r}
summary(df)
```  

### Subset of Dataframe

A subset of recalls dataframe where number of units affected for each category is greater than 400,000:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
head(subset(df, as.numeric(as.character(UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR)) > 400000))
```

## 07. Visualizations

### Plot #1. Honda/Acura Recalls

Description: 

- My workflow only looks at 4 columns: Maker (filtered as Honda or Acura), System Failure Type, Number of Units Affected and Year.

- The new dataframe is grouped by Year, and further filtered by System Failure Type to ignore entries that are either "Accessories" or "Label" (as I consider "Accessories" and "Label" to be trivial recall reasons).

```{r}
require(tidyr)
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
quandf <- df %>% select(MAKE_NAME_NM, SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT, UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR, YEAR) %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% filter(MAKE_NAME_NM %in% c("HONDA", "ACURA"), SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT != "Accessories", SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT != "Label")
```

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  coord_cartesian() + 
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs(title='Honda/Acura Recalls') +
  labs(x="YEAR", y="UNITS AFFECTED") +
  layer(data=quandf, 
        mapping=aes(x= as.numeric(as.character(YEAR)), y=as.numeric(as.character(UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR)), color=SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT), 
        stat="identity", 
        stat_params=list(), 
        geom="point",
        geom_params=list(), 
        position=position_jitter(width=0.3, height=0)
)
```

Comment:

- The generated plot shows the number of units recalled by each type of system failure over the year of the maker Honda/Acura.

- The interesting point here is the abnormally high number of units recalled due to Airbag problem/failure in the period 2000-2010. The number is staggering compared to other scattered recalls (more than 700,000 units each year compared to the norm of below 200,000 for other types of recall), occupying a conspicuous horizontal line at the top of the graph.

- In fact, I wonder whether this might correspond to the major Takata airbag recall by Honda. The airbags, made by major parts supplier Takata, were mostly installed in cars from model year 2002 through 2008.
