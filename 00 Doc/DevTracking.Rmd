## 04. ETL
(This step may take a while to load)
```{R}
# ETL Script for Vehicle Recall Data for DV_RProject2
require(dplyr)

file_path <- ("~/DataVisualization/DV_RProject2/01 Data/vrdb_full_monthly.csv")

# read raw csv into dataframe df
df <- read.csv(file_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# scrub column names for periods, replace with underscore
names(df) <- gsub("\\.+", "_", names(df))

# check your data
str(df)

# defined 3 measures
measures <- c("RECALL_NUMBER_NUM", "YEAR", "UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR")

# scrub special characters
for(n in names(df)) {
  df[n] <- data.frame(lapply(df[n], gsub, pattern="[^ -~]",replacement= ""))
}

dimensions <- setdiff(names(df), measures)
if( length(measures) > 1 || ! is.na(dimensions)) {
  for(d in dimensions) {
    # Get rid of " and ' in dimensions.
    df[d] <- data.frame(lapply(df[d], gsub, pattern="[\"']",replacement= ""))
    # Change & to and in dimensions.
    df[d] <- data.frame(lapply(df[d], gsub, pattern="&",replacement= " and "))
    # Change : to ; in dimensions.
    df[d] <- data.frame(lapply(df[d], gsub, pattern=":",replacement= ";"))
  }
}

# no dates to format


# Get rid of all characters in measures except for numbers, the - sign, and periods
if( length(measures) > 1 || ! is.na(measures)) {
  for(m in measures) {
    df[m] <- data.frame(lapply(df[m], gsub, pattern="[^--.0-9]",replacement= ""))
  }
}

# uncomment to pare data down to 1/14th of original size (with evenly-spaced row selection)

#smalldf <- df %>% filter(row_number() %% 14 == 0)
#summary(smalldf)

#write.csv(smalldf, paste(gsub(".csv", "", file_path), ".reformatted.csv", sep=""), row.names=FALSE, na = "")

write.csv(df, paste(gsub(".csv", "", file_path), ".long.reformatted.csv", sep=""), row.names=FALSE, na = "")

tableName <- gsub(" +", "_", gsub("[^A-z, 0-9, ]", "", gsub(".csv", "", file_path)))
sql <- paste("CREATE TABLE", tableName, "(\n-- Change table_name to the table name you want.\n")
if( length(measures) > 1 || ! is.na(dimensions)) {
  for(d in dimensions) {
    sql <- paste(sql, paste(d, "varchar2(4000),\n"))
  }
}
if( length(measures) > 1 || ! is.na(measures)) {
  for(m in measures) {
    if(m != tail(measures, n=1)) sql <- paste(sql, paste(m, "number(38,4),\n"))
    else sql <- paste(sql, paste(m, "number(38,4)\n"))
  }
}
sql <- paste(sql, ");")
cat(sql)
```

-Gives us:

```
CREATE TABLE DataVisualizationDV_RProject201_Datavrdb_full_monthly (

```

## 05. Peculiarities
  -Encountered JSON parsing error when trying to fetch database

![](./Graphics/jsonerror.png)

  -After some sleuthing, pinpointed problem rows in database:
  
![](./Graphics/dbmystery.png)

  -The values looked strange, but nothing about them explained why JSON had read them as infinity. The csv files held some answers though...
  
![](./Graphics/csvsolution1.png)
![](./Graphics/csvsolution2.png)

  -A-ha! Some values in the original csv contained some codes in a number-'E'-number format, and upon reformatting they had been parsed as scientific notation.
  
  -Very few rows even contained values in the offending column, so the simplest solution seemed to be to drop the column entirely from our data. There didn't seem to be any pattern to Manufacturer's recall codes anyway.
  
  -Oracle was reacting badly to the offending data, so we eventually opted to drop the table entirely and rebuild it with a modified SQL statement.

  -While we were at it we pulled out four columns that were french translations of other columns. None of us speak French.

## 06. Summary and Subset

Creating dataframe from Oracle's database with SQL query:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
df <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('129.152.144.84:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from recalls"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521/PDBF15DV.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal', USER='cs329e_qan74', PASS='orcl_qan74', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE), ))
```

### Summary of Dataframe

```{r}
summary(df)
```  

### Subset of Dataframe

A subset of recalls dataframe where number of units affected for each category is greater than 400,000:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
head(subset(df, as.numeric(as.character(UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR)) > 400000))
```

## 07. Visualizations

### Plot #1. Honda/Acura Recalls

Description: 

- My workflow only looks at 4 columns: Maker (filtered as Honda or Acura), System Failure Type, Number of Units Affected and Year.

- The new dataframe is grouped by Year, and further filtered by System Failure Type to ignore entries that are either "Accessories" or "Label" (as I consider "Accessories" and "Label" to be trivial recall reasons).

```{r}
require(tidyr)
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
quandf <- df %>% select(MAKE_NAME_NM, SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT, UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR, YEAR) %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% filter(MAKE_NAME_NM %in% c("HONDA", "ACURA"), SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT != "Accessories", SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT != "Label")
```

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  coord_cartesian() + 
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs(title='Honda/Acura Recalls') +
  labs(x="YEAR", y="UNITS AFFECTED") +
  layer(data=quandf, 
        mapping=aes(x= as.numeric(as.character(YEAR)), y=as.numeric(as.character(UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR)), color=SYSTEM_TYPE_ETXT), 
        stat="identity", 
        stat_params=list(), 
        geom="point",
        geom_params=list(), 
        position=position_jitter(width=0.3, height=0)
)
```

Comment:

- The generated plot shows the number of Honda/Acura units recalled by each type of system failure over the years.

- The interesting point here is the abnormally high number of units recalled due to Airbag problem/failure in the period 2000-2010. The number is staggering compared to other scattered recalls (more than 700,000 units each year compared to the norm of below 200,000 units for other types of recall), occupying a conspicuous horizontal line at the top of the graph.

- In fact, I wonder whether this might correspond to the major Takata airbag recall by Honda. The airbags, made by major parts supplier Takata, were mostly installed in cars from model year 2002 through 2008.


### Plot #2: Recalls Affecting Child Safety

- My dataframe is limited to those recalls whose descriptions make reference to a child or children, and excludes manufacturers of Car Seats and Booster Seats (because they are products solely for children, and their recalls would overshadow the rate at which other manufacturers' recalls were child-related)

- This workflow looks at four variables within the aforementioned subset: Manufacturer, Number of Units Affected, Category, and Year (grouped by decade). It shows changes in frequency and scope of child-safety-related recalls across companies and time.

```{R}
df %>% filter(grepl("[Cc]hild|CHILD", COMMENT_ETXT)) %>% filter(CATEGORY_ETXT != "Child Car Seat" & CATEGORY_ETXT != "Booster Seat") %>% filter(YEAR > 1900) %>% mutate(decade = ntile(YEAR,5)) %>% group_by(MAKE_NAME_NM, YEAR, UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR, CATEGORY_ETXT, decade) %>%  ggplot(aes(x=MAKE_NAME_NM, y=UNIT_AFFECTED_NBR, color=CATEGORY_ETXT)) + geom_point() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + labs(title="Think Of The Children:\nRecalls Affecting Child Safety") + labs(x="Company(Child Seat Mfrs Excluded)", y="Scope of Recall (# Units Affected)") + facet_grid(~CATEGORY_ETXT~decade)
```

- In terms of total units recalled over the last 45 years, Ford is the clear frontrunner. However, Suzuki holds the distinction of having one of the two most widespread recalls, and having it in the 21st century-- at a point when most manufacturer's child-safety recalls were on the decline.

### Plot #03. Safety vs Archetype

-For my visualization, I explored how some of the major systems failed amongst different types of vehicles. In particullar I studied the recalls due to brakes, engine, structure, and airbag failures vs the five major types of consumer vehicles on the road: cars, light trucks, medium/heavy trucks, SUVs, and motorcycles. This data was plotted over the years in order to see if any patterns emerge.

-Unfortunatly, the manufacturers were very lazy, and the data in the SYSTEM_ETXT col, which is supposed to describe which system in particular the recall was targetting (engine, brake, etc etc), was often unspecified. In order to get around this, I used the grepl function to do a keyword search through the comments of each recall, using keywords customized to each system that fail (brake failure comments often used the word "brake", while structure failure comments never used the word "structure"). 

-In order to do this, I created new dataframes that were subsets of the original filtered so that they only contained data of a particular system that failed. I then created a new col. in these datasets called SYS_FAIL that specified which particular system they had been filtered to (brakes, engine, structure, or airbags). I then used the set union function to tranform these four datasets to one, complete dataframe called dfsysfail, which was passed into ggplot.

```{R}
require(tidyr)
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)

dfjames <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('129.152.144.84:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from recalls;"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521/PDBF15DV.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal', USER='cs329e_jht585', PASS='orcl_jht585', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE), ))
```

```{R}
#create new datasets for each particular system failure to study. Use grepl to search for keywords in the comments col, and mutate to make new col that combines info from comments and system col.

```

```{R}

```

- We can draw a couple interesting conclusions from this plot. Airbags, in particular, never saw a recall until the 1990's for cars, and even later for other vehicle types. This could be due to laws passed that required airbags, or it could be due to a change in public perception about the importance of airbags in their cars.

- The reason that there's so few recalls for SUVs can be attributed to the fact that it was not until recently that they actually became popular enough that they merited their own car archetype. 

- Another interesting pattern is that light trucks seem to have the least ammount of structural and engine issues. This holds true when for larger trucks when we compare them to cars as well. Possibly they are made sturdier, and for rougher usage, and that they therefore receive more attention during the design and engineering proccesses for issues that might arrise to poor welding and such. On the other hand, Medium and Heavy Trucks have had incredibly few recalls due to airbags over the years. I'm not sure what exactly could cause this, expect that maybe the problems with airbags stem from attempting to stuff a small bomb into a small chasie, and that with increasing vehicle size these problems are somewhat mitigated.

- Lastly, there has been a massive decrease in the number of recalls attributed to structure and engine issues since 2010 accross cars and trucks. SUVs and Motorcyles continue to have problems, but it would appear that a sigificant improbement to these two systems engineering has occured, and that the roads are at least that much safer because of it!
